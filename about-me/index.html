Hi! I'm Paul. I'm 22 years old and a Linguistics major at the Ohio State University. I love dogs, the Cubs, traveling, languages, and food. I have been to many countries in Europe, and have even lived in France for four years! In my spare time, I love to read books and play chess. I also love to code, because it allows me to be almost limitlessly creative, and I'm always learning new things about it!
<br>
<br>
Other fun facts:
  <ul>
    <li> I speak French fluently</li>
    <li>I used to have a dog named Louis (after the French king Louis V, the "do-nothing king")</li>
    <li>I used to have the first 100 digits of pi memorized</li>
    <li>One of my favorite books is Good Omens, by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett</li>
    <li>I've met the creator of the Klingon language</li>
  </ul>
